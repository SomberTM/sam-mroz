        Countless months would see thousands of actors, writers and directors go
        on strike for better pay, enhanced job security and preventive measures
        against rising technologies in the form of AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        With November 9 signaling the end of a long-fought battle between the
        Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
        and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a tentative
        deal was struck between the two sides.

        But while these storytellers clean their wounds until the{" "}

        , rising artists assess the uncertain futures that lie ahead of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For DePaul alumni Andrew Jacobson, his desire to direct continues to
        tout a mixed bag of creative emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;If you want to go into film, at its worst your facing the most
        insurmountable thing you could ever possibly imagine,&quot; Jacobson
        said. &quot;At its best, it&apos;s one of the most fruitful, with some
        of the most important artistic contributions that have ever
        happened.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Graduating last June with a degree in Film and Television from DePaul,
        Jacobson&apos;s struggle is reflective of a much broader class of
        artists, adding to a party of recent graduates faced with a professional
        world that is hesitant to accept them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this challenge, DePaul&apos;s College of Computing and Digital
        Media continues to see a steady increase in student registration,
        specifically under the major of Film and Television.
      </p>
      <p>
        As sourced from DePaul&apos;s{" "}

          annual enrollment report

        , in 2018 the program would make up 4.5% of campus-wide enrollment.
        Within four years this number would rise to 7%, making up 37% of the
        entire College of Computing and Digital Media.
      </p>
      <p>
        With DePaul providing access to onset productions after an alliance with{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://www.cinespace.com/cinespace-chicago/">
          Cinespace Chicago Film Studios
        </ExternalLink>{" "}
        in 2013, the studio hosts industry-standard equipment amidst
        high-profile network productions, including shows to that of NBC&apos;s
        &quot;Chicago Fire&quot;, &quot;Chicago Med&quot; and &quot;Chicago
        PD&quot;. Newer projects such as FX&apos;s &quot;The Bear&quot; may also
        be found renting out studio space on the lot, giving students a chance
        to peer into the careers they aim to reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        An incentive that has charmed hundreds into pursuing a degree from the
        university, rising scholars make use of the amenities offered. Adding
        even more to their academic workload, some still find the urge to create
        outside-of-school boundaries, seeking out their own opportunities to
        satiate creative urges.
      </p>
      <p>
        DePaul Sophomore Luis Danao craved an experience that offered
        camaraderie while allowing space for growth. This need would lead to the
        creation of Keychase Productions, a student-run production company that
        he founded in the spring quarter of his freshman year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having left his home country of the Philippines to pursue a career in
        entertainment, his time is spent learning in both the classroom as well
        as the broader Chicago landscape. This dichotomy, though productive, has
        taught him how important it is to be self-dependent in this line of work
        while shaping his own opinions on the need for freshman to be more
        active in their craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I feel like DePaul needs to have freshmen making more stuff
        because personally, I didn&apos;t make a lot, and that&apos;s why I
        started Key Chase,&quot; Danao said. &quot;We shoot random stuff where
        everyone&apos;s willing to make something. Where everyone is always open
        to create, to be creative.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        An openness to expression that led him across the world is the same
        intuition he provokes to stay sharp. This commitment is an asset he uses
        to try and remain distinct and as older majors will come to note,
        staying committed can beget further opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keiph Oliver, a senior in Film and Television at DePaul views his
        experience in university as a test. One that assesses your limits and
        how far you can go to stand out amongst the crowd
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I feel like college is supposed to prep us in feeling out our
        stress levels,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;It&apos;s like lifting weights.
        I want to put on as much on as possible and see if I can lift it.
        Throwing a lot of stuff on my plate to see how much of it I can
        withstand.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Now 32 years old, Keiph joined DePaul in the Fall of 2021 as a
        sophomore, using his credits from over a decade ago at Wichita State
        University to bump past freshman year. Since then, he has spent his time
        moving from one set to another, broadening his grid of artists from the
        director&apos;s chair to the lighting crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this work and networking aims to be a payout for something much
        larger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;I&apos;m always busy and it wouldn&apos;t be fun for somebody
        else, but certain sacrifices need to be made in order to get to certain
        places,&quot; Oliver said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bringing a commitment to participate with a hunger to learn, this
        instinct carries him and his work along for a ride of artistic fervor.
        But speculation still resides as he prepares for a full plunge into the
        professional arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;After senioritis starts to set in and you&apos;re ready to go, it
        almost feels like a cloud is constantly following you because
        you&apos;re always questioning what lies ahead,&quot; Oliver said.
        &quot; I&apos;m always asking myself which choice will set me up for the
        career that I want.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Choices that can carry you across decades as well as continents, the
        entertainment industry has spread far and wide across the globe. Yet
        there still remains a point of origin that this troubled industry calls
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out West in Los Angeles, people like Luis or Keiph may soon find
        themselves drawn to a city drowning in entertainment assets. For Andrew,
        it was a choice he will never forget making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following three and a half years at DePaul after transferring from
        Georgia State University during the winter quarter of his freshman year,
        Andrew would specialize in directing under the Film and Television
        major.
      </p>
      <p>
        Directing a short film while offering the occasional hand toward his
        friend&apos;s projects, he found himself sitting by Lake Michigan,
        refusing to leave until a choice was made. A decision that would either
        keep him in the city he had come to know as home or transport him to a
        town where thousands flock to in pursuit of the same dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        One call later from a friend out in L.A. who recently had a room opening
        in his apartment and the choice was made. No more lake.
      </p>
      <p>
        A year later and he continues to reflect on his education, the
        opportunity it provided him and how he perceives the industry in its
        current state.
      </p>
      <p>
        With thousands more like Andrew taking their chances at DePaul, drawn
        into a developing program that only seems to grow with each ensuing
        year, the world of media continues to face new changes by the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strikes afoot and tensions heightened, earning a degree won&apos;t
        ensure success for these art-driven creatives yet uncertainty fails to
        stifle their perspectives on what good can be reaped in the coming
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Holding on to the choices they made, what looks to be the fall of an
        industry could be the emergence of something new â€” a new way to pursue a
        good story
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;The romantic in me hopes that this fosters a new kind of landscape
        and ecosystem that film can exist in,&quot; Jacobson said. &quot; Even
        though it&apos;s currently evolving and changing in so many ways, the
        language of cinema is still relevant.&quot;
